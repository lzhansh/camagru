42 project from Web dev branch.

I used to think that web dev is so easy to learn, that I won't have problem finishig Camagru after PHP piscine. I was so wrong. 
I cannot say it is difficult, but there are so many things to know and learn and understand. PHP piscine is not enough to do web dev branch projects. 
It's like 1%. You should learn by yourself the rest 99%. No kidding.

So here is my log, not to help other people, but not to forget what i learnt. LOL. 

- Where did i start?
I went through so many online courses and the one i found useful is https://www.rithmschool.com/ . It is free and written in easy-to-get way. I went through JS basics, intermediate and some of adv lessons.
Also, covered both basics and intermediate nodejs and expressjs. Of course, some react as well. Those lessons helped me a lot, so i was able to know where should i start and how to do the project.
Another course worth to mention is SD4x: Programming for the Web with JavaScript on edx.org.

MongoDB - NoSQL Database which represents data as a collection of documents/objects rather than tables and rows.

Nodejs
